# AGENTS.md — Project Context for AI Coding Agents

## Goal

A collection of reusable AI agent skills for use with OpenCode and Claude. Skills are stored in a tool-agnostic directory structure and deployed to each tool's expected location via `link-skills.sh`.

---

## Critical Rules

- **Never run `git commit` or `git push` without explicit user permission**
- **Skill directory names must exactly match the `name` field** in the corresponding `SKILL.md` frontmatter
- **`SKILL.md` must be spelled in all caps**
- **`name` must be lowercase alphanumeric with single hyphens** — e.g. `hello-world`, not `Hello_World`

---

## Code Style & Conventions

### Skill Frontmatter

- Required fields: `name`, `description`
- Optional fields: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`
- `description` should be specific enough for an agent to decide whether to load the skill (1–1024 chars)
- `compatibility`: use `opencode` for tool-agnostic skills, `claude` for Claude-specific ones

### Skill Content

- Write instructions in plain markdown after the frontmatter
- Include a "What I do" section, a "When to use me" section, and an "Instructions" section
- Keep skills focused on a single responsibility

## Structure

```
skills/
  github/            — skills that depend on the `gh` CLI and GitHub issues/PRs
    scope-it/SKILL.md
    build-it/SKILL.md
    review-it/SKILL.md
    test-it/SKILL.md
    ship-it/SKILL.md
  standalone/        — skills with no external dependencies; work anywhere
    big-brain/SKILL.md
    cook-bruv/SKILL.md
    this-sus/SKILL.md
    roast-it/SKILL.md
    yeet-it/SKILL.md
link-skills.sh       — finds all SKILL.md files recursively, symlinks each skill flatly
README.md
AGENTS.md            — project context for AI coding agents (Codex, Gemini, etc.)
CLAUDE.md            — Claude Code entry point; references AGENTS.md
```

## Adding a Skill

1. Create `skills/<group>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (use `github/` for skills requiring the `gh` CLI, `standalone/` otherwise)
2. Ensure `name` in frontmatter matches the directory name exactly
3. Skill names must be unique across all groups
4. Run `./link-skills.sh` from the repo root to deploy
